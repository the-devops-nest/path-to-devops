# 🚀 DevOps Training Program — 4‑Month Hands‑On Curriculum

A polished, project-driven DevOps course that takes learners from fundamentals to delivering a production-ready, observable application on AWS. Focus is on practical labs, repeatable workflows, and a final capstone.

## Who this is for
- Junior developers, SREs, and ops engineers transitioning into DevOps
- Teams seeking a hands-on, instructor-ready training plan
- Instructors wanting structured labs, slides, and assessment rubrics

## Key outcomes
Participants will learn to:
- Apply DevOps culture, collaboration patterns, and delivery workflows
- Build CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions
- Containerize applications with Docker and Compose
- Provision cloud infrastructure using Terraform on AWS
- Deploy and operate applications on Kubernetes (EKS) with Helm
- Implement monitoring, logging, and basic DevSecOps checks
- Deliver a complete end-to-end capstone project

## 4‑Month Overview (weekend-by-weekend)

Month 1 — Core Fundamentals
- Weekend 1: DevOps foundations & Git
  - Class 1: Introduction to DevOps — culture, lifecycle, and value
  - Class 2: Git fundamentals — branching, PRs, merge conflicts (practical lab)
- Weekend 2: Linux & Shell
  - Class 3: Essential Linux commands and tooling
  - Class 4: Bash scripting for automation
- Weekend 3: Docker basics
  - Class 5: Container concepts and images
  - Class 6: Dockerfiles, Compose, multi-container labs
- Weekend 4: CI/CD foundations
  - Class 7: CI/CD design and practices
  - Class 8: Jenkins / GitHub Actions pipelines (hands-on)

Month 2 — Cloud & Infrastructure as Code
- Weekends cover AWS fundamentals, VPC, S3, EC2, RDS, Terraform basics, modules, and a multi‑tier infra lab.

Month 3 — Kubernetes & Observability
- Weekends cover Kubernetes concepts, EKS setup, Helm, deploying real apps, Prometheus/Grafana, and centralized logging patterns.

Month 4 — DevSecOps, Data & Capstone
- Weekends cover security in pipelines (SAST/DAST, secrets), Databricks integration overview, capstone build, and final presentations.

## Weekend / Class format
- Short conceptual session (30–45 min)
- Hands-on lab with starter code and verification script (60–120 min)
- Mini checkpoint and practical takeaway at the end

## Repository layout
- /labs — step-by-step lab guides and starter apps  
- /terraform — example modules and reference infra  
- /k8s — manifests and Helm charts  
- /ci — Jenkinsfiles and GitHub Actions workflows  
- /final-project — architecture, checklist, and rubric  
- /docs — instructor slides, notes, and templates

## Quick start
1. git clone <repo-url>
2. cd path-to-devops
3. open the desired lab folder and follow its README (each lab is self-contained)

## Final capstone
A guided end-to-end project integrating Git → CI/CD → Docker → Terraform → EKS with monitoring and security checks. Deliverables include architecture diagrams, deployment artifacts, and an assessment rubric.
