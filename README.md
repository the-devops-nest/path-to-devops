# 🚀 DevOps Training Program — 4‑Month Hands‑On Curriculum

A polished, project-driven DevOps course that takes learners from fundamentals to delivering a production-ready, observable application on AWS. Focus is on practical labs, repeatable workflows, and a final capstone.

## Who this is for
- Junior developers, SREs, and ops engineers transitioning into DevOps
- Teams seeking a hands-on, instructor-ready training plan
- Instructors wanting structured labs, slides, and assessment rubrics

## Key outcomes
Participants will learn to:
- Apply DevOps culture, collaboration patterns, and delivery workflows
- Build CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions
- Containerize applications with Docker and Compose
- Provision cloud infrastructure using Terraform on AWS
- Deploy and operate applications on Kubernetes (EKS) with Helm
- Implement monitoring, logging, and basic DevSecOps checks
- Deliver a complete end-to-end capstone project
